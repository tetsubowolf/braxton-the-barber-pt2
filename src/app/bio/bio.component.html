<p>My name is Braxton Robinson. I have graduated from both Sebring School of Cosmetology and Trend 
    Barber College. I currently hold a Class A Barber License in Texas. I have been cutting hair for 
    roughly eight years during which time I have been able to craft and hone my skills in the tonsoral arts.
    I dont mean to brag but there are some glowing reviews about me on Google. In my free time I enjoy 
    hiking, record shopping, listening to live music, findinga nice and quite spot to enjoy some locally 
    crafted beer, or hanging out with my girlfriend and her son. If you ever find yourself on the west side
    of 1488 in Magnolia Texas and realize you need a cut, feel free to swing by and ask for Braxton.
    I'd love the opertunity to get you looking great!
